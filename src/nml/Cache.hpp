/**
 * Base idea: enable caching of some objects by default (configurable)
 * 
 * Once an objet is compiled, call a method e.g cache(const Syntax::[*]&)
 * If cache is off for type -> do nothing
 * If cache is on for type -> hash element, store compiled data on disk
 * 
 * Cache format: compiled data...
 *
 * At start: load every cached objects in memory (threaded reading) also reading cache can be performed while compiling
 * And store them into some sort of "atlas" (for faster reading when needed)
 * Also set a limit to memory cache size & auto discard used elements so new ones can be loaded
 *
 * Atlas in the form: map<Hash, std::string>
 *
 * struct Cached { std::string content; std::size_t uses; }; ///< Auto discard in a thread using 'GC'
